<h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr>
<h2>Haikyuu: Battle of the Garbage Dump</h2>
<p>There isn't enough I can say about this anime movie. 
    It is a part of an anime series called Haikyuu
    which is about volleyball. Conentrating on live
    lessons through volleyball and showing incredible
    character development. You fall in love with the
    characters and can relate them to your life.
</p>
<h2>Star Wars: Revenge of the sith</h2>
<p>The whole of the Star Wars saga is incredible
    however this one really cemented itself in the saga
    as the movie with the best story telling and movie
    reveals. You get this effect even more if you watch 
    the two inital trilogies in the same manner Goerge 
    Lucas produced the movies. First starting with second
    trilogy (4-6) then watching (1-3) with 3 being 
    "Revenge of the Sith".
</p>
<h2>Sonic 3</h2>
<p>This one is more recent and is in the list for 
    the emotions it makes you feel and also the pure 
    nostalgia. However, due to the cast and writing 
    it elevates the movie above a normal video game
    movie. It is thrilling, captivating and has
    characters you will fall in love with.
